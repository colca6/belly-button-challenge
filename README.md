Module 14 homework
1. // use D3 library to read in JSON (provided link in "Instructions" on bootcampspot)
    solution is modeled after instructor post in Slack (Edward Apostol):
    "demo of using d3's json() method to retrieve data from a URL."

2.  For the plots and the box that held the meta data about the selected item,
    these were covered in mod 14, specifically section 1.  

I had an exceptionally difficult time trying to parse through the json and html elements,
trying to pull out the ones needed and doing the right things with them.

I tried using the "trace1" etc method, I ended up resorting to lots of googling,
however, I didn't keep track of bits and pieces here and there to document.

I was able to finally get the fields figured out, and create the plots, but I was unable to figure 
out how to make the multiple plots update when a new item was selected.  Only the meta-data box worked,
even though it seems like the others have the same approach.

Overall, I thought this was by far the most difficult, confusing assignment we've had in this class.
